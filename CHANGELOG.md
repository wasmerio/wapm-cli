## **[Unreleased]**

## [0.4.0] - 2019-11-11
### Added
- `wapm add` and `wapm remove` command to add and remove dependencies from the wapm manifest

### Changed
- `wapm init` is now interactive: run `wapm init -y` to accept all defaults
- `wapm.lock` now uses relative paths; it can safely be shared and used on different systems

## [0.3.7] - 2019-07-31
### Added
- Remove unwrap in validate subcommand 
- Make update notifications async; add config option

## [0.3.6] - 2019-07-23
### Added
- Hash of Wasm modules to lockfile for faster startup times
- Update notification and check that runs daily

## [0.3.5] - 2019-07-16
### Added
- Proxy support using standard env vars (`ALL_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `http_proxy`) and add override in config, for example: `wapm config set proxy.url "https://username:password@example.com"`
- Updated Wasm interface syntax

## [0.3.4] - 2019-07-05
### Added
- Improved Wasm Interface manifest format
- fixes and improvements for Wasm Interface

## [0.3.3] - 2019-07-02
### Changed
- use the author the registry sends over to look for a saved public key to validate the package/new public keys with with

## [0.3.2] - 2019-07-02
### Added
- `disable-command-rename` field in `package` which prevents the first argument (usually the name of the program) from being edited by wapm (it's edited to provide better feedback when things like the `--help` command run). Programs that rely on the first argument, like python, need renaming disabled.
- `--force-yes` flag to `wapm install` which accepts all prompts
- `--dry-run` flag to `wapm publish` which runs the publish logic without sending anything to the registry
- validation of the manifest on publish, all commands must reference valid modules
- wapm will now suggest a package to install that contains the desired command if the command is not found

### Changed
- Files in the wapm module are now relative to their locations in the manifest. This means that going into the directory of an installed global package lets you run it as if it were local. This improves consistency and usability and allows programs interfacing with packages to be simpler.
- Renamed Wasm Contracts to Wasm Interfaces
- Lockfile version 3 with package root directory added
- Changes to the pkg-fs api

## [0.3.1] - 2019-06-19
### Added
- Bug fix to stop wapm from entirely blocking consuming unsigned packages from producers for whom the consumer has a public key
- `keys generate` convenience subcommand
- Package filesystem support allowing filesystems to be bundled with wapm packages

## [0.3.0] - 2019-06-17
### Added
- Wasm contracts (experimental way of validating imports and exports)
- Package signing
  - Packages can be signed and verified with Minisign keys
  - `wapm keys` for relevant subcommands
- SQLite database as backing store for data like keys and contracts

## [0.2.0] - 2019-05-06
### Added
- Install packages with name and version e.g. `wapm install lua@0.1.2`.
- Fall back to default for `WASMER_DIR` env var if it doesn't exist
- Global install packages from the registry with `-g`/`--global` flag.
  - Packages are installed into `WASMER_DIR/globals`.
  - Packages are runnable from any directory that does not already have that package installed.
- Packages are runnable from any directory that does not already have that package installed.
- List subcommand (`wapm list`) to show packages and commands installed
- Enforce semantic version numbers on the package and dependencies.
- Allow ranges of semantic versions when declaring dependencies e.g. `"_/sqlite": "^0.1"`
- Uninstall a package with `wapm uninstall` and use the `-g` flag for global uninstall.
- Get the bin directory for wapm-run-scripts using `wapm bin` command.
- Publish wapm package with license file

### Changed
- Refactored process for generating updates to manifest, regenerating the lockfile, and installing packages.
